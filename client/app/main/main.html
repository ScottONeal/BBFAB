            <p>
              I met Forrest this past summer through a close friend. From the beginning his beard has stood out to me.  And honestly, we don’t really know Forrest well, but feel incredibly thankful for his willingness to step up and a Beard Grower for us! Here is what he had to say: 
            </p>

            <p>
              My name is Forrest J. Page and I come from a family of educators and manliness.  I am the oldest of two children from Mason, Michigan where the corn grows tall and the beards long.  Currently, I am teaching at Grand Rapids Ellington Academy of Arts and Technology.  My life consists of a lot of work, listening to music, raising my children, spending time with my family, and being a brawny man.
            </p>

            <p>
              I signed up to grow this beard for a few reasons.  One, if you are good at something never do it for free! Two, I support the Barkers in their quest to adopt.  Some of my best friends were adopted out of Korea.  
            </p>

            <p>Beardy Things:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>I built a log cabin by hand in high school.</li>
            <li>I am single father </li>
            <li>My beard is red, eyebrows are brown, and hair is blonde</li>
            <li>My beard makes me play my guitar better.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We want you all to feel like you know a little bit about our Beard Growers. So our first one up is:</p>
            
            <p>
              Steve Caldwell was one of the first people to sign up to be apart of our crazy fundraiser. And we are so thankful for it! Even before it started he was researching different beard styles to figure out how he wanted, says his wife, Christine. Even though I don’t know Steve personally. I’m incredibly thankful for his support in our adoption and as a brother in Christ. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>Why did I become a beard grower for BigBeardsForABaby?</strong><br />
            Adoption is close to my heart. God has adopted me as His son, and calls me to take care of orphans and widows. The Barker family is living this out in a real, tangible way - loving an orphan, weaving him or her into the fabric of their family, as they become parents again. I am so moved by their desire to grow their family this way, in obedient response to God’s calling. It blesses me to be a small part of the good work in helping them to raise the ransom to bring their baby home.
            <br /><br /> 
            Also, I’ve been wanting to see what kind of face forest I could grow, so that’s a bonus.
            </p>
             
            <p>
              <strong>What do I do for a living?</strong><br />
              I’m a mathlete with a business degree. Mostly, I’m a marketing consultant and I advise non-profit clients based on data analysis and statistics.
            </p>
               
            <p><strong>Other beardy things about me:</strong></p>
             
            <p>
              My whiskers are one hundred percent organic, pesticide free and zero percent genetically modified. This is serious hippy business on my face. I’ve got beard balms, oils and tonics, scissors, combs, and a beard brush. My sponsors should know I don’t mess around.
            </p>
             
            <p>Good music makes my heart and my beard happy.</p>
             
            <p>
              These facial hair follicles started their adult life as Spartans - in the marching band at MSU, Freshman year – Go State!
            </p>
             
            <p>
              My wife loves my beard, and my beard loves my wife. We’ve been married for twelve years of real life, and she’s cheering on my face for six months without a shave.

            <h2>Big Beards for a Baby</h2>
            <p><i>Posted October 15th 2014</i>
            <p>Friends and Family,</p>
            
            <p>
                Thanks for taking the time to take a look at our page. As most of you know we have started on the journey of adoption. As of today we are in the middle of our home study process, which means that we are being evaluated on if our family is at a place where the social worker we are working with believes that we are fit to be the parents to another child. This process has been a lot of fun and has brought a lot of introspection for us within our marriage and our family. This has been great for our relationship and our family. 
            <p>
                
            <p>  
                After the home study process, that will be submitted through our agency to the US government to be approved and then through the Korean government to be approved. After all that, we will get a referral! That will more than likely come 6 months to 1 years after we finish the home study. Could it be sooner than that? Yes!! Could it take longer? Yes! But we trust God that he is going to bring another wonderful and beautiful child into our lives to give a home and a family, just as we have been adopted to be co-heirs with Christ, before God the Father. We are very excited:)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now onto why you are on this website! We are kicking off our second fundraiser on november 1st and it is pretty simple. Here is the lowdown:
            </p>
               
            <p> 
                We are starting a beard-a-thon, we don't discriminate and so this is for the girls too! If you can grow a beard we want you to grow it for us! What that looks like is you volunteer for the beard-a-thon and you start growing that beard! Once you sign up we give you a welcome pack, you start looking for sponsors for your beard. The goal that we would give everyone would be to find 10 sponsors that would be willing to sponsor you for $10 per month for all six months! That would be a total donation of 60 per sponsor and a total of $600 per beard grower.
            </p>
               
            <p> 
                So here are the things that you can do to help us with the goal:
