            <h1>Big Beards for a Baby</h1>
            <p>Friends and Family,</p>
            
            <p>
                Thanks for taking the time to take a look at our page. As most of you know we have started on the journey of adoption. As of today we are in the middle of our home study process, which means that we are being evaluated on if our family is at a place where the social worker we are working with believes that we are fit to be the parents to another child. This process has been a lot of fun and has brought a lot of introspection for us within our marriage and our family. This has been great for our relationship and our family. 
            <p>

                After the home study process, that will be submitted through our agency to the US government to be approved and then through the Korean government to be approved. After all that, we will get a referral! That will more than likely come 6 months to 1 years after we finish the home study. Could it be sooner than that? Yes!! Could it take longer? Yes! But we trust God that he is going to bring another wonderful and beautiful child into our lives to give a home and a family, just as we have been adopted to be co-heirs with Christ, before God the Father. We are very excited:)

                Now onto why you are on this website! We are kicking off our second fundraiser on november 1st and it is pretty simple. Here is the lowdown:
            </p>
               
            <p> 
                We are starting a beard-a-thon, we don't discriminate and so this is for the girls too! If you can grow a beard we want you to grow it for us! What that looks like is you volunteer for the beard-a-thon and you start growing that beard! Once you sign up we give you a welcome pack, you start looking for sponsors for your beard. The goal that we would give everyone would be to find 10 sponsors that would be willing to sponsor you for $10 per month for all six months! That would be a total donation of 60 per sponsor and a total of $600 per beard grower.
            </p>

                So here are the things that you can do to help us with the goal:
